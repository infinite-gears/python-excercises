### Exercise: Calculate the Fibonacci Sequence

#### Problem Statement

Write a Python function `calculate_fibonacci(n)` that calculates the first `n` numbers in the Fibonacci sequence and returns them as a list.

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. In this exercise, consider the Fibonacci sequence to start with 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, ...

#### Example

```python
>>> calculate_fibonacci(5)
[0, 1, 1, 2, 3]

>>> calculate_fibonacci(10)
[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```

#### Constraints

- The input `n` is a positive integer.
- Your function should handle `n` values up to 100.

#### Notes

- You may use recursion or an iterative approach to solve this problem.
- Consider implementing the function efficiently to handle larger values of `n`.

## Solutions
